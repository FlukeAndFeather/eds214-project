# Exceeds spec

## The code is appropriately commented
I think the comments on my code are well organized and explain thoroughly the code segments to the best of my knowledge. I referenced the repositories referenced in class to see how other people comment their code. 

## The README includes a flowchart and text explaining how the analysis works
I think my readme includes a flowchart that depicts my workflow thoroughly and is able to be understood by people outside of this project. 

# Collaboration

I peer reviewed Melannie's work and Marie peer reviewed my work. During my peer review, I was throughouly impressed with Melannie's work and only created Issues with minor work. For instance, I felt that Melannie could have expanded more on the functionality language of the rolling mean function (see here: https://github.com/mmorenorolon/hurricane-streams/issues/14#issue-3364727419). This was also the part of the collaboration that I edited in my own forked repo of her project.
