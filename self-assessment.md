## The analysis produces the expected output
Not yet: My analysis is incomplete so far in the project. 

## Data import/cleaning is handled in its own script(s)

## At least one piece of functionality has been refactored into a function in its own file
Not yet: Roxygen skeleten for function is incomplete. 

# Document 

## The repo has a README that explains where to find (1) data, (2) analysis script, (3) supporting code, and (4) outputs
Not yet: Need to add section about finding the analysis script and outputs. 

## The README includes a flowchart and text explaining how the analysis works

## The code is appropriately commented
Meets spec: I have commented on all the work I have done so far, but will finish this as I finish up the document. 

## Variable and function names are descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention
Not yet: some of my variables are lower-cased while some are upper-cased and I need to stick to lower-case. 

# Scale
