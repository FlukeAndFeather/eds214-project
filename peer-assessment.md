# Automate

Not met- I'm unable to render your 'paper.qmd'- The error is in reading your csv's. At the top of the script i would add a code chunk where it has all your libraries as a message. - need to add the library(tidyverse)

unable to see expected outputs. 

met- data cleaning was handled in its own

# Organize
met-  Raw data is contained in its own folder

met- raw data in its own folder. outputs are saved in a separate script.

# Document
Not yet- The repo has a README that explains where to find (1) data, (2) analysis script, (3) supporting code, and (4) outputs

Not yet-  The README includes a flowchart and text explaining how the analysis works. 
- I would add more on how the analysis work was completed

met- The code is appropriately commented. I feel like your comments are good on the code

met- Variable and function names are descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention

#Scale
not yet- Running the environment initialization script installs all required packages. I would add in what libraries and installation package are needed for reproduciibility
